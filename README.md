## "Adaptiv-AI" 
AI Models for Industrial Electric Load Forecasting under Changing Data Patterns
Based on historical energy data and external variables, predictions are made about future electrical energy consumption.

## Benifits if Load Forcasting in industires ##

* Basis for energy procurement (avoidance of balancing energy costs)
* Support for cost reduction through peak load management
* Promotion of organizational measures for energy flexibility
* Support for the integration of renewable energies
* Contribution to the reduction of the CO2 footprint
